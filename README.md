Following is a kotlin project developed in android studio platform for android IDE


Following project is a clone of instagram app that uses firebase authentication and real time data base as backend.

The UI design as well as all the drwable files are no subject to copyright.You can easily use them in your projects.

I have deleted the Json file for firebase database so you have to download the jSon file by creating your own firebase database and hence allowing the sign up method of email and password from firebase authentication.

I request you to only download the source coode in src directory with extensions .xml and .java files. Downloading the complete project sometimes lead to errors and file disabilities in android studio IDE. hence,downloading the source codes and placing them in your own project will be the best way. Dont forget to download the gradle files i have uploaded,for dependencies. Or an active internet connection will make the android studio bring them automatically to your project,reading the source codes. Dont forget to get the drawables too. That's it developer,you are good to go!!

I have also uploaded a demonstration video of the following project which you can watch using the following link.Copy paste the link in your browser to reach my instagram post.
